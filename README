Proof of concept implementation of the eight++ language framework

This is a Eclipse CDT project

Follow the development at http://eightplusplus.blogspot.com/

Prerequisites:

https://github.com/cinder/Cinder

http://www.codesynthesis.com/projects/xsd/

http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/

(Since Cinder is currently compiled only for 32 bit architecture, care should be taken to ensure that other components are also 32 bit, for example if you build xerces-c yourself on OS X, use "-arch i386" flag)
